Take full control of the affected system

Technical Details
The vulnerability behind CVE-2022-24086 is based on Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) issues known in Magento2. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious template code into the application, which is then executed on the server-side. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code, manipulate the web application, or even exfiltrate sensitive data.
